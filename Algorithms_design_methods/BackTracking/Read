**Programs solved with backtracking algorithm**

  Because of time complexity and memory usage this brute force search algorithm is not the best to solve many problems. Even on some ocassions it may not find the optimal
  solution. It may be better to check if Branch and Bound algorithm works better. However this algorithm technique works for this problems for low n.

  1.-Sudoku
      - Fill a board of 9x9 squares divided in sub-boards of 3x3 squares with some numbers given in some squares. The goal is to not repit a number in any row, column 
        or sub-square.
  
  2.-Check if two digraphs are isomorphic. 
      -Checks if it exists a bijective aplication between the vertices of one digraph with the other.
  
  3.-Knight's moves.
      - Checks if a knight can go to every square of the board without repeting any of them.
